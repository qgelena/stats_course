In September and October 2019 I studied the 7-week course "Statistics for Biologists", organized by Stepik Academy (https://academy.stepik.org/) and earned a certificate about successful completion (https://stepik.org/cert/251352). During this course, I learned skills in basic statistics and R programming & visualization. This course was well structured and used real datasets connected to biological topics. Upon completing the course, I started to study other courses such as "Big Data for Data Science", which I completed as well (https://stepik.org/cert/268288) and "Introduction to Data Science and Machine learning" (https://stepik.org/course/4852). 

Here you can find my R notebooks from this course:

[Report 2: Intro to Exploratory Data Analysis](stepik_report_2.html)

[Report 3: Central limit theorem, qq-plots, confidence intervals](stepik_report_3.html)

[Report 4: EDA, Spearman & Pearson correlation](stepik_report_4.html)
